        <div class="itsabout">
        <p> Bitcoin is the worlds first digital currency.The
            inventor of Bitcoin is supposedly a man or group of
            people called, "Satoshi Nakamoto". When Nakamoto left the 
            project, he gave ownership of the domain to additional people, 
            separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread responsibility 
            and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control 
            over the Bitcoin project. The open softeware was released in 2009 and 
            gives users the power to make transactions directly to one another. 
            These transactions go through a network ledger. Bitcoins are stored in 
            a “digital wallet,” which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer. 
            The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, 
            pay for goods or save their money. Unlike bank accounts, bitcoin wallets are not insured by the FDIC. 
            Nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Bitcoin transactions are secured 
            by military grade cryptography. Bitcoins are 'mined', using computing power in a 
            distributed network. This network also processes transactions made with the virtual 
            currency, effectively making bitcoin its own payment network. say that only 21 million 
            bitcoins can ever be created by miners. However, these coins can be divided into smaller 
            parts (the smallest divisible amount is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin and is called a 'Satoshi', 
            after the founder of bitcoin). Goldman Sachs is weighing whether to launch a bitcoin trading operation.
            Goldman is in the early stages of creating a trading operation specifically geared toward cryptocurrencies.
            No one knows what will become of bitcoin. It is mostly unregulated, but that could change. Governments are 
            concerned about taxation and their lack of control over the currency. More merchants are beginning to accept them: 
            You can buy webhosting services, pizza or even manicures.
